# Framework

The client framework choice: gpui (locked) vs. React/TS over Tauri (rejected).
Owns the rationale, the reconnaissance summary, the residual spike items, and
the framework-specific seams the other specs reference.

**Status:** Draft, 2026-06-23. Locked at gpui per capability map decision D.
**Depends on:** the capability map's decision D (resolved: gpui).
**Feeds:** every other spec — they cite "framework divergent points" and rely
on the gpui substrate decisions pinned here.

---

## 1. Decision: gpui (LOCKED)

**Resolved: Lens is built on gpui.** Three inputs drove the lock:

1. **Greenfield removes migration cost.** No existing app to port.
2. **The all-Rust win is unopposed.** The typed client's typed Rust enums flow
   straight into the UI — no IPC boundary, no JSON serialization at the seam.
   This is the single largest architectural advantage of Lens over a
   React/TS-on-Tauri alternative, where every `ServerStreamEvent` crosses the
   JS boundary and loses the type.
3. **The reconnaissance retired the *terminal/diff/board* widget risk** — but
   **not all** of it. The GPUI recon (§2), sourced from three reference GPUI apps
   — Arbor / Paneflow / gpui-flow — proved the terminal, diff, and board widgets
   are buildable with working templates. **Two renderers remain un-spiked and
   load-bearing: incremental/streaming markdown (§4.1) and the JSON-Schema
   elicitation form renderer (§4.3).** Treat these as hypotheses pending a spike,
   not retired risk. (The recon was a read of the three apps, summarized in §2;
   there is no separate "recon artifact" file — §2 *is* the record.)

**Bridge-webview risk is gone** — the Bridge (capability map §0.6) is rebuilt
native, no webview.

## 2. Reconnaissance summary

The GPUI reconnaissance cloned three apps at HEAD on 2026-06-04 and read
them in parallel via subagents: **Arbor** (`penso/arbor`, MIT), **Paneflow**
(`ArthurDEV44/paneflow`, GPL-3.0 — ideas only, reimplement), **gpui-flow**
(`pacifio/gpui-flow`, MIT). What they proved, and what Lens reuses:

### 2.1 The async-stream → state → render bridge

GPUI has no built-in SSE/WS. Arbor's pattern (the load-bearing template):

- A dedicated **OS thread** holds the blocking socket (`tungstenite` or
  `reqwest` blocking).
- Writes parsed events into an `Arc<...>` of atomics / an mpsc channel.
- A **UI-thread poller** drains it via `this.update(cx, |this, cx| { …mutate…;
  cx.notify() })` (gpui's reactive notify).
- All I/O is in `cx.background_spawn`, never on the UI thread.

This maps cleanly onto Lens's pump-task→bounded-channel→store→subscribers
model (state model §8). The state model's §14 "framework divergence notes"
calls out this single crossing as the one framework-specific point — gpui's
`cx.spawn` + entity update on the foreground executor is the implementation.

### 2.2 Terminal widget

`alacritty_terminal` (Zed's fork) + `portable-pty`. Bytes → bump a
`generation` counter → on render walk the grid → shape text (cached) → paint
quads+runs in a `canvas()` element. Arbor's `arbor-terminal-emulator/` is
the template (MIT — copyable into Lens with attribution).

Lens's terminal surface (workspace doc §9) uses this pattern. The ring
buffer (workspace doc §9.2) is a Lens-local addition layered on top.

### 2.3 Diff widget

Computes diffs client-side from two strings via `gix-diff` / `imara-diff`
Histogram → flat `Vec<DiffLine>`. Renders with native `uniform_list`
virtualization. Syntax highlight via `syntect`, **precomputed + cached in an
`Arc`, not per-render** (this is the load-bearing performance fix — a naive
per-render highlight is slow on large diffs).

Arbor's `arbor-gui/src/diff_engine.rs` `build_side_by_side_diff_lines` is the
template (MIT — copyable). The workspace doc's §4 diff computation is this
pattern, pinned.

### 2.4 Canvas / board

`gpui-flow` (React-Flow clone for GPUI) shows pan/zoom + viewport culling for
a large card canvas. **Lens's board is NOT a free-form canvas** (capability
map: ordinal slots, not pixels — the shell spec §4.1 is the keystone fix).
Lens's board is bounded + ordinal (not a free-form/infinite canvas), so it's a
responsive reflow grid of cards — **simpler than a free-form canvas**. No
node-graph edges/handles;
`gpui-flow`'s pan/zoom is not strictly needed, but its viewport culling
pattern is a reference if the board grows large.

### 2.5 Markdown security boundary

Paneflow's `markdown/security.rs` (GPL — ideas only, reimplement) is the
standout: treats markdown as **hostile-by-default** (it renders agent/LLM/tool
produced content, exactly Lens's transcript case).

- `validate_link_url` allows only `http(s)` before handing a click to the
  OS opener — blocks `file:`, `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, bare-host,
  >8KiB.
- `validate_image_ref` guards path-traversal + scheme injection + symlink
  escape + remote-beacon images.

**Lens's transcript renderer must carry this boundary** before any
click-to-open or image-load ships (transcript doc §6.1).

### 2.6 Reusable widgets

Paneflow built shared primitives; confirms the "build one reusable
text/scroll component" recommendation. A custom `scrollbar` is itself a
small gpui-gap tell. Lens inherits the guideline to build custom primitives
once, not per surface.

### 2.7 Tiling layout engine (deferred)

Paneflow's `src-app/src/layout/` (~1170 LOC): N-ary
`LayoutTree { Leaf | Container{direction, children, …} }`, ratio-based flex,
recursive render, drag-to-resize dividers. Useful later if Lens wants split
terminals / side-by-side diff+editor; the shell spec's working area
(shell §7.2 — tab + split) is a fixed-4-zone layout for now and doesn't need
the full tiling tree.

---

## 3. GPUI distribution

Two distribution choices:

- **Published `gpui = "0.2.2"` from crates.io** (Arbor's path; easy on-ramp).
- Git-pin `zed/zed` or a Lens-owned fork (Paneflow / gpui-flow's path; needed
  when you must patch gpui).

**Lean: crates.io by default.** Forking is a one-way door — only take it when
a fix upstream doesn't land. The markdown-append fix (§4) is the likely
trigger; re-evaluate at the spike.

---

## 4. Residual spike items

The recon retired the terminal/diff/board risk; **two** open items remain
load-bearing — markdown (§4.1) and the JSON-Schema form renderer (§4.3):

### 4.1 Markdown rendering (the one spike item)

GPUI has no first-class markdown renderer. Paneflow **forked gpui** for a
markdown-append fix **and** built its own `pulldown-cmark` → element view.
Two implications for Lens:

- **Budget a hand-rolled `pulldown-cmark` → gpui element renderer.** A
  naive dep on a "gpui markdown" crate will not give stream-append support;
  the transcript doc §5 (progressive markdown, safe-prefix) requires a parser
  that handles incremental input.
- **The link/image sanitization boundary** (§2.5) is built into the
  renderer, not a separate post-process pass.

**The spike**: stand up the renderer against a captured SSE stream and verify
(a) safe-prefix streaming works, (b) the link/image boundary holds, (c)
in-place diff with stable identity doesn't remount on finalize, (d) the
transcript's variable-height virtualization holds (transcript §16/§19 —
`uniform_list` is uniform-height, so this needs a custom virtualizer).

**Fallback ladder if the markdown spike blocks** (escalate only as far as
needed): (1) `pulldown-cmark` → gpui element renderer on published gpui; (2)
git-pin a Lens fork with the markdown-append fix (Paneflow's path, §3); (3)
last resort, degrade to non-streaming finalize-only markdown (render plain text
live, swap to formatted markdown on item finalize) — uglier but unblocks ship.

### 4.3 JSON-Schema elicitation form renderer (second spike)

The permissions form-mode elicitation (permissions §3) renders an arbitrary
`requested_schema` JSON Schema as a gpui input form. gpui has no JSON-Schema
form primitive, so this is a hand-rolled renderer (string/number/enum/boolean/
nested-object fields → gpui inputs, with validation). **Un-spiked.** Spike:
render the common omnigent elicitation schemas and confirm submit produces a
valid `ElicitationResult.content`. Fallback if a schema is too complex to render
natively: fall back to the url-mode approval page (permissions §3) or a raw
key/value editor.

### 4.2 Other GPUI gaps (carried, smaller)

- **No granular subscriptions.** `cx.notify()` re-renders the whole view. The
  state model §14 mitigates by using per-entity state (`Entity::observe`);
  the shell + surface specs lean on per-session `SessionStore` entities, not
  a global store, to avoid invalidating the foreground render.
- **Custom drags need explicit `window.refresh()`** on mouse-move. gpui only
  auto-repaints during `cx.has_active_drag()`. Lens's board drag uses
  ordinal slots (no drag-physics), so this gap is less load-bearing than it
  would be for a free-form canvas.
- **Roll-your-own scrollbar.** The built-in was insufficient for Paneflow;
  expect to build a custom scrollbar primitive, reused across surfaces.
- **`canvas()` prepaint to capture laid-out pixel bounds** during interaction
  — confirmed idiom across both Arbor and Paneflow (drag clamping, container
  sizing).

## 5. Framework-specific seams the other specs reference

Each spec has a "framework divergence" section. What each one owns vs. here:

| Spec | Owns there | Resolved here |
|---|---|---|
| typed client | (no framework impact) | The async runtime is tokio; the gpui→tokio hand-off is below |
| state model §14 | State primitive (gpui `Entity::observe` vs alternative store); the channel→UI crossing (`cx.spawn` + entity update) | gpui's per-entity notify + `cx.spawn` is the implementation |
| application shell §17 | The board (ordinal-slot responsive reflow vs a free-form canvas) | §2.4 of this doc — confirmed ordinal board is *simpler*, not harder, in gpui |
| transcript §19 | Progressive re-render (stable-identity in-place diff); markdown library; virtualization | §4.1 markdown spike; `uniform_list` is gpui-native **but uniform-height only** — the variable-height transcript needs a custom virtualizer (spike, §4.1d) |
| workspace §9 | Terminal widget | §2.2 — `alacritty_terminal` + `portable-pty`, Arbor template (MIT) |
| workspace §4 | Diff widget | §2.3 — `imara-diff` + `syntect` cached, Arbor template (MIT) |
| permissions | (no special widgets — form renderer uses gpui inputs; JSON-schema form renderer is a one-off build) | — |
| sub-agent topology | (no special widgets — rail/tree uses gpui list primitives) | — |
| server lifecycle | (no widgets — backend) | — |

## 6. Non-goals of this document

- Not the gpui *API tutorial* — that's the gpui docs.
- Not the build system — cargo workspace is implementation detail, spec'd
  in the typed client's §1 (where it's load-bearing for the seam).
- Not a React/TS-over-Tauri comparison. The decision is locked; the rejected
  alternative is documented here only where it sharpens why gpui won (the
  IPC seam is the headline — every `ServerStreamEvent` loses its type at a
  JS boundary).
- Not a performance budget. Benchmarks are a verification-pass concern
  (capability map §0.8).

---

## 7. Open questions

- **gpui version pin** — `0.2.2` from crates.io is a starting point; revisit
  at first build. Newer gpui releases may pass (Paneflow forked for the
  markdown-append fix); whether Lens can stay on a published version or
  needs a fork is gated on the §4.1 spike.
- **Hot-reload of themes** — the shell §18 ships hot-reload; gpui's support
  for swapping a `Theme` struct at runtime is assumed. Verify at build.
- **Window resize behavior for the focused-session window** — shell §7.1's
  "boards stay visible (shrunk)" needs the layout to reflow cleanly on
  resize; ordinal slots (shell §4.1) make this deterministic, but gpui's
  actual resize behavior at the element level needs a verification pass.
