# Lens — STATUS

Lean, living status for the Lens design effort. Keep this doc **small**: it holds
the current forward-looking state only. **Full dated session entries live in
[`STATUS-ARCHIVE.md`](./STATUS-ARCHIVE.md)** — write each session's detail there
and roll older "Recent" pointers off this page as they age.

## Next up

- **▶ Board packing B6–B8** — the last structural piece of board-home (continues the wave build;
  B1–B5 shipped). Scope per the `docs/design/renders/board-home.html` mockup is **three sub-features**,
  not just a scrollbar: (B6) vertical scroll container + adaptive auto-fill grid; (B7) stable ordinal
  ordering (today it's a placeholder `session_id` string sort in `board/mod.rs:187`); (B8) **grouped
  lanes** — the mockup wraps cards in per-`workspace` lanes (`.gwrap`: colored border, header with
  aggregate `$cost · Nd` + "N done" pill). The card model already carries `workspace` + `cumulative_cost`
  for the group key/aggregation.
  - **Acceptance gate (the one genuinely-remaining perf item):** full-scale >8-card off-screen
    culling has never been exercised on-device — there's no scroll container yet. It rides *with* B6;
    it is not a separate task.
  - **Heads-up carried from the freeze fix:** B6's scroll container is a *different* off→on transition
    than focus↔board. The current fix (`BoardView::recover_viewport_gates_on_reentry`) is edge-based on
    the focus↔board mode switch — a card scrolling back into view has **no mode change**, so it won't
    trigger the gate reset. B6 needs either its own scroll-driven gate reset or a revisit of the general
    approach (paint-safe `on_next_frame` is clean on-device but a no-op in the test platform). Detail in
    memory [[viewport-reentry-freeze]] and `docs/handoffs/2026-07-17-viewport-reentry-freeze.md`.

- **▶ `lens-ui` transcript fan-out** — the first real consumer of the Detailed feed + the disk
  `RowSource`/D23 render window (markdown + virtualization spikes both GO). Plugs into the slot API the
  shell skeleton publishes; sibling parallel surfaces (terminal via `lens-terminal::open`, workspace,
  permissions) can fan out against `ContentTab`/`TabHandle`.
  - **Carry-forward arch notes:** a Summary-mode card consumer MUST tolerate occasional
    `Detailed(TranscriptAdvanced)` watermarks (catch-up/deferred-commit emit them regardless of mode).
    §3.5 Ready *policy* (seen_turn detector / `last_completed_at` stamp / per-card decay one-shot /
    focus-suppress) is lens-ui work over §3.4's `last_completed_turn`. Design spec REVIEW-CLOSED:
    `docs/specs/2026-07-14-lens-ui-shell-skeleton-design.md` — settled, don't re-litigate.

- **⏳ Terminal Slice 2 (interaction)** — planned + execution-ready on branch `terminal-ws`;
  **being executed by a separate agent.** Don't double-drive. Design = single-owner engine + one
  ordered command stream (memory [[terminal-slice-2-design-ghostty-precedent]]).

- **📋 SPEC-GAPS backlog** — independent, un-specced/partial items tracked in
  [`docs/SPEC-GAPS.md`](./SPEC-GAPS.md) (incl. #10 keyboard shortcuts + macOS app menu, Cmd+Q dead).

## Deferred, with a clean seam

- **lens-client modeling follow-on** — flip the 13 byte-verified SSE families `SCHEMA-DERIVED→MODELED`
  (capture done, memory `live-event-recapture-findings`); grow the two under-modeled payloads (`child{}`,
  elicitation `params`). Still-blocked families (`turn.*`, `response.created/queued`, codex reasoning)
  need a codex sub / OpenAI key.
- **lens-client small hardening** — `info.databricks_features: Value` leak; `ClientError::NotFound`
  rename + typed `Validation`/422; `/items` pagination; gated live-reconnect smoke.
- **WS terminal-attach client (Plan 7)** — no `terminal.rs`/`tungstenite` yet; workspace/terminal half
  of the contract is a known build-order deferral (converging with sibling `lens-terminal-ws`).
- **`session.superseded` reducer-drop** (`folds.rs:136` discards `target_conversation_id`) blocks
  terminal supersession-reattach — lens-core must surface it; terminal-integration-era.
- **Notifications v2** — server push for the fully-quit case (needs an upstream omnigent push channel).
- **Reducer normalization** — two status vocabularies (`SessionStatusValue` 6-val live vs
  `SessionStatus` 3-val snapshot) + two usage representations to normalize consumer-side.

## Open small decisions

- **Tunables (verification pass):** auto-sleep threshold (~10m), poll cadence (~10s), ring-buffer size
  (10 MB), transcript truncation tiers, `cost_samples` cadence.
- **Undecided UX:** terminal-`transfer` UX, managed-provider selection, policy/skill in-app authoring,
  multi-depth breadcrumb, exact-vs-range version pin.
- **Build artifact:** all status/harness/render glyphs are real Lucide SVGs (bell, triangle-alert,
  loader-circle, alarm-clock, check, moon, coffee, circle-dot, folder, git-branch). Only chrome
  furniture is still unicode — the kebab `⋮` and close `✕` (trivially swappable to `ellipsis-vertical`/
  `x` if/when a fully-bespoke set is wanted).

## Recently shipped (all on `main` unless noted)

- **Wave build B1–B5 + follow-ups (2026-07-17):** Lucide glyph tiles, context pbar, Slept/Wake/Retry
  seams, `loader-circle` spinner, canvas `paint_path` sweep, Scheduled countdown, viewport-gated
  20fps/1Hz anim driver, `demo` feature-gate; on-device visual pass; per-wave card-body wash; header
  3-tier type + host pill + per-wave activity line; **perf 30→20fps** (~35% CPU, `wave-perf-fps-attribution`).
  Spec `2026-07-17-wave-behaviors-design.md` §11. Handoff `2026-07-17-wave-build-visual-pass-merged.md`.
  - **Viewport re-entry freeze — RESOLVED (2026-07-17):** focus→board no longer freezes the off-screen
    card's spinner/pulse. Reset lives in `BoardView`'s fleet-observe effect; 3 regression tests; codex
    review addressed. Memory [[viewport-reentry-freeze]]. **Unpushed on `main`** (see below).
- **§18 Theming substrate (2026-07-16):** `crates/lens-ui/src/theme/` — `LensTheme` global (base+status
  tokens, hex↔Hsla serde, dark+light JSON), `cx.lens_theme()`, gpui-component bridge, external-file load
  + `cmd-shift-t` reload, `shortcuts.rs`. **On `main`, load-bearing for the cards.** Palettes tuned
   during the 2026-07-17 §11 on-device visual pass (bg ramp, wave status colors, context-bar thresholds,
   per-wave wash intensities) — no longer placeholders; residual fine-tuning is cheap via the reload
   loop. Memory [[lens-ui-theming-fork]].
- **`lens-ui` shell skeleton Plan 2 + card/board audit (2026-07-15/16):** §4–§7 skeleton merged; wave
  colors un-swapped, Needs-input=orange, icon-tile readout. Gate now covers lens-ui/lens-app.
- **lens-core §3 ActorFeed gate (2026-07-15):** unified `ActorFeed` FIFO, scheduler dual-mode,
  seed-on-spawn + emit-on-Demote, enriched `SummaryUpdate`. Grok-authored plan, subagent-driven.
  Memory [[grok45-as-plan-author]].
- **state-model engine P0–P3 (2026-07-08 → 07-12):** domain types → pure reducer → two-tier SQLite
  persistence → actor + store + commands + P3-3a/b lifecycle. All merged. Memories `state-model-*`.
- **lens-client (2026-06-25 → 07-10):** REST surface (Plans 2a–2e), SSE event modeling (Plan 3 series),
  benchmarks, pre-consumer hardening (Plan 4), omnigent pin `0.3.0.dev0 → 0.5.1`. Memories `plan3*`, `plan4*`.

## Housekeeping

- **`main` pushed to `origin` (2026-07-17)** — the wave follow-ups + viewport freeze fix are on
  `origin/main` (`b8727ab`). In sync.
